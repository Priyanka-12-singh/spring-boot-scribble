A real-time Pictionary-style game where players guess words while others draw, built with Java and Spring Boot (REST APIs) → for backend logic.

JPA/Hibernate + MySQL/Postgres → for storing game state, users, scores.

REST + JSON → instead of WebSocket at first (simpler).

Frontend → plain HTML/JS or React (you can keep it minimal).

Authentication → Spring Security with JWT or OAuth (optional).
